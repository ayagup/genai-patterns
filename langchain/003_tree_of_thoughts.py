"""
Pattern 003: Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT)

Description:
    Explores multiple reasoning paths simultaneously in a tree structure.
    ToT allows the model to generate multiple candidate thoughts at each step,
    evaluate them, and search through the tree (BFS or DFS) to find the best solution.

Components:
    - Thought Generation: Creates multiple candidate next steps
    - State Evaluation: Scores each thought/state
    - Search Strategy: BFS, DFS, or beam search
    - Backtracking: Can revisit and try alternative paths

Use Cases:
    - Strategic planning and game playing
    - Creative writing with multiple storylines
    - Complex problem-solving with multiple approaches
    - Optimization problems

LangChain Implementation:
    Uses LangGraph for state management and custom search logic for tree exploration.
