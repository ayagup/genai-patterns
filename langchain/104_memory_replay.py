Pattern 104: Memory Replay & Rehearsal

Description:
    The Memory Replay & Rehearsal pattern implements mechanisms for re-experiencing
    and strengthening memories through replay, similar to how the human brain
    consolidates memories during sleep and practice. This pattern is crucial for
    learning, skill retention, and memory consolidation in long-running agent systems.
    
    Memory replay involves re-activating stored experiences to strengthen neural
    patterns, transfer information from short-term to long-term storage, and discover
    new insights through recombination. Rehearsal can be exact (episodic replay) or
    generative (synthetic variations), and can occur during downtime, triggered by
    context, or scheduled periodically.
    
    This pattern supports various replay strategies including experience replay
    (reinforcement learning), prioritized replay (focus on important memories),
    interleaved replay (mixing old and new), and generative replay (creating
    variations). It implements replay scheduling, priority calculation, and
    consolidation effects.

Key Components:
    1. Memory Buffer: Store of experiences to replay
    2. Replay Strategy: Algorithm for selecting memories
    3. Replay Scheduler: When to perform replay
    4. Priority Calculator: Importance scoring
    5. Consolidation Engine: Strengthening mechanism
    6. Synthetic Generator: Create variations
    7. Replay Metrics: Track effectiveness

Replay Types:
    1. Experience Replay: Re-live past experiences
    2. Prioritized Replay: Focus on important/surprising
    3. Interleaved Replay: Mix old and new memories
    4. Generative Replay: Create synthetic variations
    5. Forward Replay: Chronological order
    6. Reverse Replay: Reverse chronological
    7. Random Replay: Random sampling
    
Replay Timing:
    1. Offline Replay: During downtime/sleep
    2. Online Replay: During active tasks
    3. Triggered Replay: By context or cues
    4. Periodic Replay: Scheduled intervals
    5. Event-driven Replay: After significant events

Use Cases:
    - Reinforcement learning agents
    - Skill learning and retention
    - Memory consolidation systems
    - Experience-based learning
    - Pattern recognition improvement
    - Knowledge transfer and generalization
    - Continuous learning systems

Advantages:
    - Strengthens important memories
    - Improves learning efficiency
    - Enables offline learning
    - Prevents catastrophic forgetting
    - Discovers new patterns
    - Transfers knowledge
    - Simulates "sleep consolidation"

Challenges:
    - Computational cost of replay
    - Selecting which memories to replay
    - Balancing old vs. new experiences
    - Avoiding overfitting to replayed memories
    - Determining replay frequency
    - Managing replay buffer size

LangChain Implementation:
    This implementation uses LangChain for:
    - LLM-based memory importance assessment
    - Synthetic memory generation
    - Pattern extraction from replay
    - Learning from replayed experiences
    
Production Considerations:
    - Schedule replay during low-activity periods
    - Implement priority-based sampling
    - Monitor replay effectiveness metrics
    - Limit replay buffer size
    - Balance replay with new experiences
    - Track memory strengthening
    - Implement incremental consolidation
    - Consider computational budget

    summary = """
    The Memory Replay & Rehearsal pattern demonstrated:
    
    1. BASIC REPLAY (Example 1):
       - Memory storage in replay buffer
       - Selection and replay of memories
       - Memory strengthening through consolidation
       - Replay statistics tracking
    
    2. REPLAY STRATEGIES (Example 2):
       - Prioritized: High-importance first
       - Random: Random sampling
       - Recent: Newest memories
       - Oldest: Oldest memories
       - Strategy comparison and selection
    
    3. STRENGTHENING (Example 3):
       - Progressive strength increase
       - Multiple replay sessions
       - Replay count tracking
       - Consolidation effects
    
    4. PRIORITY CALCULATION (Example 4):
       - Importance weighting
       - Recency consideration
       - Success metric integration
       - Replay count balancing
       - Automatic priority ranking
    
    5. INTERLEAVED REPLAY (Example 5):
       - Mixing old and new memories
       - Balanced temporal distribution
       - Prevents recency bias
       - Catastrophic forgetting prevention
    
    6. GENERATIVE REPLAY (Example 6):
       - Synthetic memory generation
       - LLM-based variations
       - Knowledge expansion
       - Creative recombination
    
    7. AGENT INTEGRATION (Example 7):
       - Periodic automatic replay
       - Experience-based learning
       - Strongest memory identification
       - Continuous consolidation
    
    8. STATISTICS TRACKING (Example 8):
       - Buffer usage monitoring
       - Replay session counting
       - Strength progression
       - System performance metrics
    
    KEY BENEFITS:
    ✓ Strengthens important memories
    ✓ Improves learning efficiency
    ✓ Enables offline consolidation
    ✓ Prevents catastrophic forgetting
    ✓ Discovers new patterns
    ✓ Simulates sleep consolidation
    ✓ Supports continuous learning
    
    USE CASES:
    • Reinforcement learning agents
    • Skill learning and retention
    • Memory consolidation systems
    • Experience-based learning
    • Pattern recognition improvement
    • Knowledge transfer and generalization
    • Continuous learning systems
    
    BEST PRACTICES:
    1. Schedule replay during low-activity periods
    2. Use priority-based selection for efficiency
    3. Balance old and new experiences
    4. Monitor strengthening effectiveness
    5. Limit replay buffer size appropriately
    6. Track replay metrics for tuning
    7. Consider computational budget
    8. Implement gradual strengthening
    
    TRADE-OFFS:
    • Computational cost vs. learning benefit
    • Replay frequency vs. new experiences
    • Buffer size vs. memory usage
    • Exact vs. generative replay
    
    PRODUCTION CONSIDERATIONS:
    → Schedule replay during off-peak hours
    → Implement priority-based sampling for efficiency
    → Monitor replay effectiveness metrics
    → Set appropriate buffer size limits
    → Balance replay with new experience learning
    → Track memory strength progression
    → Implement incremental consolidation
    → Consider distributed replay for scale
    → Use batch processing for efficiency
    → Monitor computational costs
    
    This pattern enables efficient memory consolidation and learning
    through strategic replay and rehearsal, mimicking human memory
    consolidation during sleep and practice.
