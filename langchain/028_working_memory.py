Pattern 028: Working Memory

Description:
    The Working Memory pattern provides an active workspace for the agent's current
    task processing. Unlike short-term memory (conversation history) or long-term
    memory (persistent storage), working memory holds intermediate results, active
    goals, and context needed for the current cognitive task. It's dynamically
    updated as the agent progresses through multi-step reasoning.

Components:
    - Active Goals: Current objectives being pursued
    - Intermediate Results: Partial solutions and computations
    - Task Context: Relevant information for current task
    - Attention Focus: What the agent is currently processing
    - Scratch Space: Temporary storage for calculations

Use Cases:
    - Multi-step problem solving
    - Complex reasoning tasks
    - Task decomposition and execution
    - Mathematical computations
    - Planning and execution monitoring

LangChain Implementation:
    Uses structured state management to track active goals, intermediate
    results, and task progress. Implements focus mechanisms to maintain
    relevant context during complex operations.

Key Features:
    - Task-scoped memory
    - Goal tracking
    - Intermediate result storage
    - Dynamic updates
    - Context relevance filtering

The Working Memory pattern demonstrates:

1. **Active Workspace**: Maintains current task context
2. **Goal Tracking**: Monitors progress on objectives
3. **Intermediate Storage**: Stores partial results
4. **Attention Focus**: Tracks current processing target
5. **Capacity Management**: Limited capacity (Miller's Law)

Key Components:

Goals:
- Hierarchical goal structure (main goal â sub-goals)
- Status tracking (active, in-progress, completed, blocked)
- Result storage
- Parent-child relationships

Intermediate Results:
- Temporary computation storage
- Linked to specific goals
- Time-stamped for ordering
- Available for later steps

Attention Focus:
- Single goal actively processed
- Context switching between goals
- Maintains processing coherence

Working Memory Characteristics:

Capacity Limitation (Miller's Law):
- 7Â±2 items simultaneously
- Prevents cognitive overload
- Forces prioritization
- Matches human working memory

Dynamic Updates:
- Content changes as task progresses
- Old items removed when complete
- New items added as needed
- Maintains relevance

Task-Scoped:
- Cleared between tasks
- Fresh workspace for each problem
- No cross-task contamination

Differences from Other Memory Types:

vs Short-Term Memory:
- Working: Active processing workspace
- Short-term: Conversation history buffer
- Working is goal-oriented, short-term is sequential

vs Long-Term Memory:
- Working: Temporary, task-scoped
- Long-term: Permanent, cross-session
- Working is volatile, long-term persists

Use Cases:
- Multi-step problem solving
- Complex calculations
- Task planning and execution
- Reasoning chains
- Resource allocation

Benefits:
- **Organized Processing**: Structured approach to complexity
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor goal completion
- **Context Maintenance**: Relevant information available
- **Intermediate Access**: Use partial results
- **Cognitive Modeling**: Mimics human working memory

This pattern is essential for agents tackling complex, multi-step
