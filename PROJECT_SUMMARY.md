## 💡 Usage Examples

### Running a Single Pattern
```python
# Import and use
from react_pattern import ReActAgent, Calculator

agent = ReActAgent(tools=[Calculator()])
result = agent.run("Calculate 25 * 4 + 10")
```

### Combining Patterns
```python
# ReAct + RAG for intelligent research
from react_pattern import ReActAgent
from rag_and_memory import RAGAgent, VectorStore

# Create knowledge base
store = VectorStore()
# ... add documents ...

# Create RAG-enabled tool
rag_tool = RAGAgent(store)

# Use with ReAct agent
agent = ReActAgent(tools=[rag_tool])
```
