- **Average File Size:** ~550 lines

### Progress Metrics
- **Before:** 90/170 patterns (52.9%)
- **After:** 93/170 patterns (54.7%)
- **Progress:** +3 patterns, +1.8%
- **Duplicates Identified:** 2 patterns (91-92)

### Category Completion

## Technical Decisions

### 1. Duplicate Pattern Handling
**Decision:** Skip patterns 91-92 as they duplicate existing implementations
**Rationale:** 
- Pattern 43 already provides semantic memory with knowledge graphs
- Pattern 66 already implements attention mechanisms
- Avoids code duplication and maintains consistency
- Allows focus on genuinely new patterns

### 2. Advanced Planning Category
**Decision:** Create new category for sophisticated planning patterns
**Rationale:**
- Distinct from basic Reasoning & Planning patterns
- Represents more advanced techniques (multi-objective, probabilistic, contingency)
- Natural grouping of related planning approaches
- Provides clear progression path

### 3. Type Safety Fixes
**Decision:** Fixed all type checking issues in Pattern 95
**Implementation:**
- Changed `callable` to `Callable[[Dict[str, Any]], float]`
- Fixed tuple unpacking in `sample_outcome()`
- Added explicit type checks for `Optional[BeliefState]`
- Ensured type consistency throughout

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Duplicate Detection
- Catalog numbering doesn't always align with implementation sequence
- Important to check for conceptual duplicates before implementing
- Skipping duplicates improves efficiency

### 2. Category Organization
- New categories emerge naturally as implementations progress
- Advanced variants of basic patterns deserve separate categorization
- Category creation helps with navigation and understanding

### 3. Type Safety
- Type hints require careful attention with complex types
- `Callable` types need full signature specification
- Optional types need explicit null checks in conditionals
- Worth the effort for better IDE support and error detection

### 4. Demonstration Complexity
- Planning patterns benefit from rich demonstrations
- Monte Carlo simulations add credibility
- Multiple scenarios show flexibility
- Statistics provide concrete validation
